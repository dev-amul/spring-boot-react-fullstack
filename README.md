# Architecture

The project follows a modular component-based architecture typical of React applications. It uses modern JavaScript practices and React hooks for managing component lifecycle and state.


* Component-based structure for scalability and reusability
* Functional components with support for React hooks
* Uses JSX for defining component templates
* Client-side routing can be integrated using React Router
* State management with React state or additional libraries if needed

# Tech Stack

This application is built using the latest web technologies and tools to ensure optimal performance and developer experience.



* JavaScript as the core programming language
* Java for backend
* React as the frontend UI library
* Create React App as the project scaffolding tool
* Webpack and Babel for build and transpilation
* ESLint and Jest for code quality and testing
* HTML and CSS for layout and styling

# Setup

Follow the steps below to set up the application for local development.



* Ensure Node.js and npm are installed on your system
* Navigate to the project directory
* Run npm install to install project dependencies
* Use npm start to launch the development server
* Open http localhost 3000 in your browser to view the app
* Use npm test to run the test suite in watch mode

# Deployment

The application can be built and deployed using standard web hosting or cloud platforms.


* Use npm run build to generate a production-ready build
* Build output is stored in the build directory
* Files are optimized and minified for best performance
* Output can be deployed to services like Netlify Vercel GitHub Pages or your own server
* Refer to Create React App documentation for detailed deployment options

# Features

This React project includes several useful features for efficient development and performance optimization.


* Hot reload during development for instant feedback
* Linting and error reporting in the console
* Pre-configured testing setup with Jest
* Code splitting and lazy loading support
* Customizable build and configuration using eject
* Progressive Web App support optionally enabled

# Customization and Advanced Usage

Create React App allows advanced users to take full control of the configuration through the eject command.


* Run npm run eject to copy all config files to your project
* Modify Webpack Babel ESLint and other tools directly
* This operation is permanent and cannot be reversed
* Recommended only if specific customizations are needed
